Making Bulk Workorders
----------------------

Be **VERY** Careful.  This opertion is immediate and will
broadcast a WO to all users at once.  These WOs are automatically
assigned to each worker and pre-approved.  

### Title
Since all workorders have unique titles, this program puts 
numbers in each title.  You must include the characters "`##`" in
the title to signify where you want the number to be put.
 
### Filter Tags
If you leave the Filter Tags field empty, this WO will
be sent to all users with the Worker tag.  Otherwise the
workorder will be sent to just the users with the given tags.
