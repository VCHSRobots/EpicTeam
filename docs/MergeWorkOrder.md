About Merging
-------------

Two work orders can be merged into one.  The Primary WO remains in the system with the same header fields (title, receiver, requestor, author, dates, etc.) as they existed before the merge.  The Secondary WO is marked as closed.  The text of the Secondary WO is appended to the first.  In addition the added data associated with the Secondary is copied and associated with the Primary.  Finally, assigned workers for the Secondary are reassigned to the Primary WO, and they are unassigned from the Secondary

**Warning**: This operation is immediate and irrevocable.  Be sure you want to do it before clicking Submit.

After merging, you should visit the updated Primary WO to review and edit as necessary.
