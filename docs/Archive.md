Notes about Archive
-------------------

With this page, you can mark a Work Order as "archived".  Archived Work Orders
remain in the system, but they become invisible and will not be listed in
any search list, assignment list, closed list, and so forth.  In addition, 
Archived Work Orders do not participate in any compiled statistics.  

This means, by archiving a Work Order you effectively deleting it from the
system. This may cause confusion for workers who expect to be able to find
Work Orders they have dealt with.  On the other hand, archiving Work Orders
is an effective means to clean up the system by removing test and demo
work orders that don't convey useful information.

You can also resurrect a archived work order with this page.
