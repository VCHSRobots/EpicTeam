How to Upload Users in Bulk

1. Prepare a CSV file that has the following column headers:
    * `UserName`   
    * `Password` or `PasswordHash`  
    * `LastName` 
    * `FirstName`
    * `NickName`
    * `Title`
    * `Email`
    * `Tags`
    * `Active`

2. The headers labels must be spelled exactly as shown above.

saved as a CSV file.

4. Under the columns, add the names of the users and their
data as appropriate.
