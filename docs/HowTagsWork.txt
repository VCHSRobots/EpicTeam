How Tags Work:
01/05/16 DLB

Each user can be flaged by a set of tags, seperated by slashes. For example:
"Worker/IPTLead".

For this system, this are the meanings of the tags:

Admin     -- Can do everything, see everything.
Editor    -- Can do everything except major admin stuff, like change accounts.
HeadCoach -- Doesn't give privilege, just marks this person as head coach.
Caption   -- Marks these people as captains, and allows them to give captain approval.
IPTLead   -- General leads, can do most things, but not admin.
Worker    -- Doesn't give grivilege, just flags these as avaliable for assignment to WOs.
Guest     -- Removes all ability to update the database.  Can be used with any other tag.
